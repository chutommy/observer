# Observer library
The Observer is a software for a face recognition and face tracking devices. The
application is able to fully and reliably control the movement of the camera
using two servomotors in any direction. The real-time recognition algorithm is
provided by the optimized computer vision library OpenCV.

The entire software was developed with a performance in mind and all decisions
were made to be perfectly compatible with low-end PCs (aiming to be runnable on
minicomputers like Raspberry Pis).

## Dependencies

The observer uses these technologies to run properly:

* [Go v1.14](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Gobot v1.14.0](https://gobot.io/)
* [GoCV v0.23.0 ](https://gocv.io/)
* [OpenCV v4.3.0](https://opencv.org/)
* [HaarCascade](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/)

## Installation

Tested on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+:

*With `go`, `opencv4`, `gocv` and `gobot` installed, run this command to install
executable file into your **PATH**:*

```bash
$ go get github.com/chutommy/observer-rpi
```

**OR**

Download the source and run the `install.sh` file as a sudo user in the project
root directory to install all dependencies and the Observer software (can take
up to 15 minutes).

```bash
$ sudo ./install
```

### Post-install steps

Type `./observer -h` or `--help` in a terminal to get more info about the
observer command.
